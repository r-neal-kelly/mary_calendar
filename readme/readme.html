    <li>an up-to-date browser</li>
    <li>JavaScript</li>
    <li>cookies if you want to save (3)</li>
  </ul>
</div><br>

<div style="text-align: center">~~~~~~~~~~</div><br>

<div style="text-align: center">(1) How to Embed:</div><br>

This is the minimum html required to embed MaryCalendar in your site:
<br><br>

<div style="font-size: .9em; padding-left: 2em">
  &lt;meta charset="utf-8"&gt;<br>
  &lt;script src="MaryCalendar.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;<br>
  &lt;div id="MaryCalendar"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
</div><br>

<div style="font-size: .96em">
  <ul style="margin: 0; padding-left: 2em">
    <li>A &lt;meta&gt; tag with UTF-8 or higher.</li>
    <li>A script tag containing where to find MaryCalendar. This example 
    assumes she's in the same directory as the html file loading her.</li>
    <li>A div with the id "MaryCalendar". This is her home, so take care 
    of her, alright?</li>
  </ul>
</div><br>

She defaults to a size of 336px squared, but you can change this in 
her tag, like so:
<br><br>

<div style="font-size: .9em; padding-left: 2em">
  &lt;div id="MaryCalendar" size="420px"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
</div><br>

<div style="font-size: .96em">
  <ul style="margin: 0; padding-left: 2em">
    <li>The suggested minimum size is 216px.</li>
    <li>Along with the size, you may style her tag however you like. But 
    she will override three properties: border-box, width, and height. 
    Width and height are set to your chosen size, and border-box ensures 
    an accurate rendering.</li>
    <li>And although it's not required that you use a &lt;div&gt; tag, 
    some other tags may not behave as expected.</li>
    <li>She should not interfere with any of your CSS and hopefully none 
    of your JavaScript. She does use local storage (or document.cookie) 
    to save (3). So don't completely clear them, and everything should 
    be okay.</li>
  </ul>
</div><br>

<div style="text-align: center">(2) How to Config</div><br>

Besides the options that are in her settings, you can also configure 
the JavaScript manually by changing the values in the "config" object 
near the top of MaryCalendar.js
<br><br>

<div style="text-align: center">(3) A Note on Saving</div><br>

Enabled cookies allows for the preferred saving method: HTML5 Local 
Storage. But if the browser doesn't have local storage, MaryCalendar 
will still try to save settings with cookies, however not any notes. 
This is due to cookie-size constraints on some browsers. Saving can be 
completely disabled in the config, or by turning off cookies altogether.
<br><br>

If you want to see what MaryCalendar is storing, open the browser's 
console and type in "localStorage" and/or "document.cookie". She uses 
the prefix "MaryCalendar_" for all her variables.
<br><br>

<div style="text-align: center">Don't Panic</div><br>

During testing, I encountered a rare bug that ended up with me not being 
able to access any of my notes. The bug is fixed now, but should there 
ever be any difficulty getting to your notes in MaryCalendar, 
you can copy and paste the following code into your browser's console 
while the current web page containing her is open. (To access the 
console try hitting 'F12' on your keyboard or looking in the options 
menu. Mobile generally doesn't allow access to the console, so try 
this on desktop/laptop.)<br>

<div style="font-size: .84em; white-space: pre; padding-left: 2em">
(function getNotes() {
  const notes = Object.create(null);
  for (let key in localStorage) {
    if (/MaryCalendar_.*\d$/.test(key)) {
      let prop = key.replace(/[^_]+_/, "");
      notes[prop] = localStorage[key];
    }
  }
  return JSON.stringify(notes, null, "  ")
    .replace(/\n/g, "\n\n");
}());
</div><br>

Now you can copy her text and save it in any text editor. Make sure to 
leave out any quotes next to the '{' and '}' symbols. After resetting the 
calendar, you can try restoring your notes normally.

(א) Inspiration from the Scripture (ת)
</div><br>

<div style="text-align: center">
~~~Matthew 5:17-20~~~
</div><br>

<div style="font-size: .96em">
<span style="font-size: .76em">17</span>
Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I am not 
come to destroy, but to fulfil. 
<span style="font-size: .76em">18</span>
For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass one jot or one 
tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled. 
<span style="font-size: .76em">19</span>
Whosoever therefore shall break one of these least commandments, and 
shall teach men so, he shall be called the least in the kingdom of 
heaven: but whosoever shall do and teach them, the same shall be called 
great in the kingdom of heaven. 
<span style="font-size: .76em">20</span>
For I say unto you, that except your righteousness shall exceed the 
righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees, ye shall in no case enter 
into the kingdom of heaven.

<div style="text-align: center">
~~~Matthew 22:34-40~~~
</div><br>

<div style="font-size: .96em">
<span style="font-size: .76em">34</span>
But when the Pharisees had heard that he had put the Sadducees to silence, 
they were gathered together.
<span style="font-size: .76em">35</span>
Then one of them, which was a lawyer, asked him a question, tempting him, 
and saying,
<span style="font-size: .76em">36</span>
Master, which is the great commandment in the law?
<span style="font-size: .76em">37</span>
Yahshua said unto him, Thou shalt love Yahweh thy God with all thy heart, 
and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind.
<span style="font-size: .76em">38</span>
This is the first and great commandment.
<span style="font-size: .76em">39</span>
And the second is like unto it, Thou shalt love thy fellow kin as thyself.
<span style="font-size: .76em">40</span>
On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets.

In the first day ye shall have an holy convocation: ye shall do no 
servile work therein.
<span style="font-size: .76em">8</span>
But ye shall offer an offering made by fire unto Yahweh seven days: in 
the seventh day is an holy convocation: ye shall do no servile work

<span style="font-size: .76em">9</span>
And Yahweh spake unto Moses, saying,
<span style="font-size: .76em">10</span>
Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye be come 
into the land which I give unto you, and shall reap the harvest thereof, 
then ye shall bring a sheaf of the firstfruits of your harvest unto 
the priest:
<span style="font-size: .76em">11</span>
And he shall wave the sheaf before Yahweh, to be accepted for you: on 
the morrow after the sabbath the priest shall wave it.
<span style="font-size: .76em">12</span>
And ye shall offer that day when ye wave the sheaf an he lamb without 
blemish of the first year for a burnt offering unto Yahweh.
<span style="font-size: .76em">13</span>

mingled with oil, an offering made by fire unto Yahweh for a sweet 
savour: and the drink offering thereof shall be of wine, the fourth 
part of an hin.
<span style="font-size: .76em">14</span>

the selfsame day that ye have brought an offering unto your God: it 
shall be a statute for ever throughout your generations in all your 
dwellings.
<br><br>

<div style="text-align: center; font-variant: small-caps">
The Feast of Weeks
</div><br>

<span style="font-size: .76em">15</span>
And ye shall count unto you from the morrow after the sabbath, from the 
day that ye brought the sheaf of the wave offering; seven sabbaths 
shall be complete:
<span style="font-size: .76em">16</span>
Even unto the morrow after the seventh sabbath shall ye number fifty 
days; and ye shall offer a new meat offering unto Yahweh.
<span style="font-size: .76em">17</span>
Ye shall bring out of your habitations two wave loaves of two tenth 
deals: they shall be of fine flour; they shall be baken with leaven; 
they are the firstfruits unto Yahweh.
<span style="font-size: .76em">18</span>

offerings, even an offering made by fire, of sweet savour unto Yahweh.

poor, and to the stranger: I am Yahweh your God.
